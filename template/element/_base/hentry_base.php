			<p>As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired.  Forty millions of miles it was from us–more than forty millions of miles of void.  Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims.</p>
			<p>Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light, three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty space.  You know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night.  In a telescope it seems far profounder.  And invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth.  I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile.</p>
			<p>That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet.  I saw it.  A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place.  The night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.</p>
			<p>That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one.  I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes.  I wished I had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me.  Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house.  Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace.</p>
